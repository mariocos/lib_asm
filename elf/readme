What is a off_t?

by my understanding its supposed to be a standard var type for file sizes.
its supposed to be able to change depending on computer arch

/* How to find the .text section */
ok so its kinda hard to explain this because the file format is quite complex,
I sugest you read the wikepedia page on the elf file format and also do some extra research first.

The first thing we need to do is to parse the Elf file Header.

	this is a 64 byte long header with alot of information. for this part we need mainly two things out 
	of this header: the e_shoff (elf section header offset) and the e_shstrndx (section header string table index).
	the e_shoff is pretty simple to understand, it points to the start of the section headers in the file.
	the e_shstrndx is a bit more complicated to understand. so what is it

		the key concepts to understanding this part is that the section headers are placed together in a 
		kind of array where each header is 64 bytes long. they are not stored in any particular order and
		they do not hold their own name, instead they have a index to their respective entry in the 
		section header string table.

	So to find out wich section header belongs to wich section we need to do some detective work.

		first we locate the section header string table header by using the e_shstrndx value in the elf header
		then we go into this entry in the section header array and find the location in the file where theese
		strings are located.
		after this we can parse through the section headers and analise theyre respective entry to the string table
		to find its name.

By doing this we now have alot of valuable information.
	-Elf header.
	-elf section header array.
	-section header string table.

with this we can find any section we desire.

i am now trying to figure out how to insert code into the .text section.

i still canot read opcodes so i need to create a tool for this.
